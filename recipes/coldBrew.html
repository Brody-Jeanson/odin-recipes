    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Cold brew coffee is made chilled, never heated, and with a higher coffee to water ratio than regular drip coffee.
        It's made by creating a concentrate which is then mixed with fresh water (and optional flavorings) when it's
        time to serve. Though stronger than drip coffee, cold brew actually contains less caffeine.</p>
    <h3>
        Ingredients
    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup (113 grams) whole coffee beans</li>
        <li>4 cups (907 grams) water</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Grind the coffee beans on the coarsest setting on your grinder, or in short 1-second pulses in a spice
            grinder. The grounds should look like coarse cornmeal, not fine powder. You should have just under 1 cup of
            grounds.</li>
        <li>Combine the coffee and the water</li>
        <li>Transfer the coffee grounds to the container you're using to make the cold brew. Pour the water over top.
            Stir gently with a long-handled spoon to make sure the grounds are thoroughly saturated with water.</li>
        <li>Steep overnight</li>
        <li>Cover the jar with a lid or a small plate to protect it from dust and bugs. Let the coffee steep for about
            12 hours. The coffee can be left on the counter or refrigerated; steeping time is the same.</li>
        <li>Line a small strainer with cheesecloth or flour sack cloth and place over a large measuring cup or bowl.
            Pour the coffee through the strainer.</li>
        <li>Transfer the coffee to a small bottle or jar and store in the fridge for up to a week.</li>
        <li>Serve the coffee</li>
        <li>Dilute the coffee with as much water or milk as you prefer. Serve over ice or warm for a few minutes in the
            microwave.</li>
    </ol>
